To change two vertically split windows to horizonally split

    Ctrl-W t Ctrl-W K
Horizontally to vertically:

    Ctrl-W t Ctrl-W H
Explanations:

    Ctrl-W t     makes the first (topleft) window current
    Ctrl-W K     moves the current window to full-width at the very top
    Ctrl-W H     moves the current window to full-height at far left
The Ctrl-W t part can be ignored if only two windows
